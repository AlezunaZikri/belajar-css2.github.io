        <p id="titid">For more than 1,500 years the European world believed in a flat earth. As a result, the Europeans did not dare to sail the vast oceans, afraid to fall into the sky from the edge of the flat earth. Therefore, Western imperialism and colonialism with ships traveling the open seas only began in the early 16th century AD, after believing that the earth was round! Human understanding of the spherical shape of the earth has actually existed for a long time, especially during the civilizations of India and Ancient Greece. In Islamic civilization, the spherical shape of the earth was increasingly believed during the Abbasid caliphate (132-656 H/ 750-1258 AD), then spread to Andalusia (92-979 H/711-1492 AD). Until it influenced the Renaissance movement in Europe in the 16th century AD. As time went by, scientific facts with advanced technology over the last 500 years, increasingly proved that the shape of the earth as a whole is round like a ball through space exploration. But in the 15th century H (21 AD). This issue re-emerged in the international public. Even sued the truth of the round earth shape. The Muslim community was also affected, restless and had disagreements between the pros and cons, even among ustadz and ulemas. This book is a brief response to the Flat-Erath Conspiracy by Eric Dubay (USA) and the Flat-Earth conspiracy video made by Boss Darling (Indonesia). This book will present explanations from the perspective of Aqidah, Scientific Interpretation, History to how to deal with the Global Elite.
